/* Basic Calculations:
 Define two numeric variables and calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient */

let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;

let sum = num1 + num2;
let difference = num2 - num1;
let product = num1*num2 ;
let quotient = num2 / num1 
//used wrong sign for Quotient {% --> is modulus operator}, correct one is (/)

//Use / for division when calculating the quotient.
// Use % for the remainder when you need the leftover after division.

console.log ("Sum:",sum) ;
console.log ("Difference:",difference);
console.log ("Product:",product);
console.log ("Quotient:",quotient);
